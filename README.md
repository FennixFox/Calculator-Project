# Calculator-Project
This is a stupid calculator thing with 2 cool features
there's the "!" button and the "Qdrtc" button
the "!" button does the factorial of whatever number you enter AFTER it
the "Qdrtc" button pulls up a new window that does the quadratic formula for you
All the other buttons are pretty easy to figure out

This is still a work in progress... I hope to make this grand
