# Calculator-Project
This calculator is going to try and be the best free calculator available
Currently, it is not. I have added a couple features that are new,
Such as the ability to see that really big number you just calculated.
I also added a quadratic formula button that does just what you think it does.
There's also the factorial button which isn't super uncommon, but still.
The rest of the stuff is pretty straight forward probably.
